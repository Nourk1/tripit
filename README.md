## Why This Exists  
Planning a trip often means going between flight apps, emails for housing, calendars, and weather sites. That’s confusing, inefficient, and, in turn, time-consuming.  
**TripIt** centralizes these essentials into one place, so travelers spend less time planning and more time enjoying their anticipated trip.

## Pages & Navigation  
1. **Home**: Create or select trips (stored locally). 
2. **Calendar**: Add daily agenda items like flights, meals, check-ins, etc.
3. **Calendar View**: Plan your trip timeline in a monthly calendar (via FullCalendar).
4: **Weather**: Search cities to see the weather in °F.
5. **Packing List**: Add, remove, check, or auto-generate packing items. 

---

## Usage Tips  
1. Create a trip on the 'Home' page.  
3. Select that trip and then visit 'Calendar', 'Weather', or 'Packing List'.  
4. **Weather:** Type a city name, click 'Search', and 7-day forecast is shown.  
5. **Packing List:** Edit a list freely or generate suggestions. 
6. You can close or return to the website any time; the data is stored locally.

> If features seem disabled, ensure you’ve created and selected a trip first.
